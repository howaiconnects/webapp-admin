## 1. Vision & Principles

The HowAIConnects platform is a comprehensive AI-powered SaaS solution designed to connect AI capabilities with web applications through intelligent crawling, processing, and content management. Our mission is to provide a modular, scalable platform that integrates multiple external AI services and data sources to deliver powerful dashboard experiences for various business domains.

### Key Principles:
- **Modularity**: Each integration is a self-contained module that can be developed and deployed independently.
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports simultaneous integration of multiple services for rapid MVP development.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new integrations and features without disrupting existing functionality.
- **User-Centric**: Focus on delivering value through AI-enhanced workflows and intuitive dashboards.

## 2. Theme System

The platform uses a flexible theme system built on Bootstrap 5, allowing for easy customization of colors, layouts, and components. Themes are applied globally across all dashboard variants to maintain consistency.

### Current Implementation:
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Customizable color schemes
- Responsive design for all devices
- Component-level theming support

## 3. Navigation & Layout

### Navigation Structure:
- Top navigation bar with user profile and notifications
- Sidebar navigation for dashboard sections
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep pages
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu

### Layout Components:
- Header with branding and user actions
- Main content area with dashboard widgets
- Footer with links and information
- Modal dialogs for forms and confirmations

## 4. Dashboard Examples

The platform supports 10 specialized dashboard variants, each tailored to specific business domains:

1. **AI Dashboard** - Primary AI analytics with prompt management
2. **CRM Dashboard** - Customer relationship management
3. **eCommerce Dashboard** - Online retail analytics
4. **Crypto Dashboard** - Cryptocurrency tracking
