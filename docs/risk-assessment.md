# Risk Assessment and Mitigation Steps

This document compiles risks associated with implementing the system-design blueprint for the How AI Connects monorepo's four-branch split, rated by Likelihood (Low/Med/High) and Impact (Low/Med/High). Mitigations are proactive steps, tied to milestones and docs (e.g., [merge-policy.md](merge-policy.md)). Review quarterly or post-milestone; track in GitHub Issues.

## Risk Table

| Risk ID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Steps | Owner | Milestone |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|------------------|-------|-----------|
| R001 | Merge conflicts during sync from `main` to app branches (e.g., shared adapters changes) | Medium | High | Enforce linear history (rebase merges); use Turbo for dependency graphs; weekly sync PRs with CI checks. Reference [branching-strategy.md](branching-strategy.md). | Dev Lead | M1 |
| R002 | Secrets exposure in commits or logs (e.g., API keys in adapters) | Low | Critical | Pre-commit hooks (Husky + git-secrets); CI scan for secrets; use .env.example only. Integrate [secrets-management.md](secrets-management.md) validation. Rotate keys on breach. | Security | M2 |
| R003 | CI/CD failures due to matrix complexity (e.g., parallel tests timeout) | Medium | Medium | Optimize Turbo caching; limit matrix (4 jobs max); use self-hosted runners for heavy E2E. Monitor with GitHub Insights. See [ci-cd-pipeline.md](ci-cd-pipeline.md). | Ops | M2 |
| R004 | Inconsistent naming/routes leading to bugs (e.g., API mismatches) | High | Medium | ESLint rules for conventions; auto-gen types from tRPC schemas in [route-api-guidelines.md](route-api-guidelines.md). PR templates with checklists. | Devs | M1 |
| R005 | Tooling version drift (e.g., Node 18 EOL) | Low | High | Pin versions in .nvmrc/package.json engines; Dependabot for updates; test upgrades in playground branch. Per [environment-tooling.md](environment-tooling.md). | Dev Lead | M3 |
| R006 | Documentation outdated after changes (e.g., ADR not updated) | High | Low | CI check for doc updates in PRs (e.g., action to validate README changes); link docs in code comments. Follow [documentation-plan.md](documentation-plan.md). | Docs Owner | M3 |
| R007 | Deployment downtime on prod merge to `main` | Medium | High | Blue-green deploys via Vercel; rollback via Git revert/hotfix. Manual approvals for prod. See [ci-cd-pipeline.md](ci-cd-pipeline.md). | Ops | M4 |
| R008 | Adapter integration failures (e.g., Latitude API changes) | Medium | Medium | Unit tests with mocks in packages/adapters; health checks in runtime. Monitor with Sentry. | Integrations | M4 |
| R009 | Team adoption resistance (e.g., complex branching) | Low | Medium | Onboarding sessions; templates in CONTRIBUTING.md; start with playground for training. | PM | M3 |
| R010 | Scope creep delaying split (e.g., new features in migration) | High | High | Strict milestone gates; use issues for tracking; freeze features during M4. | PM | All |

## Overall Mitigation Strategy
- **Proactive**: Integrate checks into CI (e.g., secret scan, lint); use ADRs for decisions.
- **Reactive**: Hotfix protocol for urgent issues ([merge-policy.md](merge-policy.md)); post-mortem reviews.
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for runtime, GitHub for CI metrics; quarterly audits.
- **Contingency**: 20% buffer in timeline; fallback to single-branch if split fails (low probability).

This assessment covers key areas; update with new risks via ADR. Probability based on similar monorepo projects.
