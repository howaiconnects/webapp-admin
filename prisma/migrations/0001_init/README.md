# 0001_init — Initial migration (generated from prisma/schema.prisma)

This folder contains an initial, best-effort SQL migration derived from the repository's Prisma schema: [`prisma/schema.prisma`](prisma/schema.prisma:1).

What this migration contains
- `migration.sql` — a hand-crafted SQL DDL that creates the tables inferred from the Prisma schema. It preserves:
  - table names mapped with @@map
  - columns and types inferred from Prisma types (Int -> SERIAL/INTEGER, String -> TEXT, DateTime -> TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - UNIQUE constraints declared in the schema
  - basic defaults for timestamps (now())

Assumptions and uncertainties
- The Prisma schema includes `Project.organizationId Int` but does not declare a Prisma relation field. Therefore this migration does NOT add a foreign key constraint from `projects.organizationId` -> `organizations.id`. If a relation was intended, add the FK manually or run `pnpm prisma migrate dev` locally to generate a migration with relations.
- SERIAL is used for @default(autoincrement()) (Postgres). If you prefer explicit sequences or different conventions, adjust accordingly.
- This is not guaranteed to be byte-for-byte identical to a migration produced by Prisma CLI. The authoritative approach is to run Prisma locally to generate migrations against your database.
- If your environment requires Postgres extensions (e.g., citext, uuid-ossp) those are not created here because the schema did not reference them.

Recommended next steps for maintainers
1. Review this SQL for alignment with your intended relational constraints.
2. Locally, with a Postgres DB and a valid `DATABASE_URL`:
   - Run `pnpm install`
   - Run `pnpm prisma generate`
   - Run `pnpm prisma migrate dev --name init --schema=prisma/schema.prisma` to let Prisma produce an authoritative migration.
3. If you use this file as-is, apply it with your DB tooling or CI; otherwise replace it with the autogenerated migration from Prisma.
