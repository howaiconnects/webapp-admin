# Project Status Directory

This directory contains daily markdown files generated automatically by the `status-update` script and workflow.

Each file is named by date (YYYY-MM-DD.md) and contains a summary of all Git commits made in the previous 24 hours.

This automation runs daily at 02:00 UTC and commits new status updates directly to the `main` branch.

Do not edit these files manually.
